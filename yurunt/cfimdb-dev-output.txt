0 ||| there 's something awful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders below every tarzan movie that followed it , including the UNK and boring 1980s piece UNK . once the viewer gets past the first three scenes , which are admittedly dull , tarzan and his mate continue to be like a shot , UNK non - stop boredom , dry humor , and weirdness . maureen o'sullivan is mean and ugly as jane and walks off with the movie .

1 ||| i wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on tv . i went to UNK town to see it last night at UNK . i was thoroughly pleased with the film . the beginning was a tribute to character development . they pretty much presented the way love works in reality . all of the characters were well cast . the boyfriend was innocent and endearing . the passing UNK that the pregnant girl kept having was off color , but hilarious . the bank robbery was a fun scene with clever gags that have been time UNK . their getaway car was an old beat up chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks . this made the scene even funnier .    the audience opinion about the movie should be through the roof . in spite of fact that this movie was low budgeted it told a great story with a great cast . this movie had a lot of stuff in it that some would find controversial , kudos to the producers for social UNK . i did expect a car chase scene , but the writers UNK around that to avoid the tired , cliche bank robbery UNK .   so i rate this movie an a which stands for awesome , and 9 out of ten stars .

0 ||| i confess -- emma , in my opinion , is the single greatest novel ever written . it is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be . jane austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.<br /><br />fortunately , this is not a UNK . comparison to the gwyneth paltrow version is inevitable -- that version is far less faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far less enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />there are some good elements here -- kate UNK ( having previously played UNK UNK in cold comfort farm , clearly emma 's smarter spiritual twin ) is a wonderful emma . raymond UNK makes an appropriately decorative frank churchill . the production is handsome , and the UNK are UNK /><br />that said , there are several major UNK . the first is mark strong -- first of all , he looks just right for mr. UNK . this is perhaps because he plays the role like an excellent victorian UNK . it 's in UNK /><br />the second UNK is one of length . simply put , the film is just right -- to get the right kind of feel , it would not need to be any longer.<br /><br />finally , and most significantly , there is the quality of the adaptation . austen is an UNK 's dream -- all the dialogue is there already . it only needs to be UNK down and arranged properly . andrew davies seems to think exactly that . first , this is a rather cheerful film , and the last thing emma is , is gloomy . more significantly , davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of sumptuous feast . what planet , or minor work of thomas hardy , is this come from ? it is utterly in the style and spirit of the novel . and i believe that it is not hugely UNK to try to make improvements upon -- perfection . < br /><br />watch the paltrow version , or watch kate in cold comfort farm also .

1 ||| far from disappointment ... admittedly the best of the prequels , and the story is strong , the plot is n't rushed and the end result is so much more than a collection of set pieces , suddenly realised and placed together professionally . there are zero continuity errors that can clash UNK with the original films , and the emergence of darth vader was handled so nicely that what was a cheesy moment in modern cinema is now instead beyond legendary that it wo n't ever be UNK for again . i ca n't complain at all about the dialogue , as this is star wars ... the original three films had style , cult feeling and cracking stories , and the strange dialogue added charm . the prequels were somewhat attempts to make more money , but this lack of love never shows in UNK . utterly impressive .

0 ||| i just have to say , this is one of my least favorite movies of all time . i can even count with one finger the number of times i 've seen it . i was already annoyed with john travolta , but the first time the camera pans up his body after he 's all clean - UNK looking ragged for his first trip to gilley 's , i was in disbelief . debra winger , as always , delivers a shoddy performance as the young , naive wife of bud , but with the necessary attitude to be married to a UNK and hard - working cowboy . if you 're not a country music person , which i was n't , this is 1 soundtrack that 'll have you UNK your ears with every word . if you get a chance , please avoid this movie - it will only disappoint .
0 ||| a new way to dislike goldsworthy 's work , rivers and tides does n't allow fans to see his work in motion . watching goldsworthy build his pieces , one develops no appreciation for every stone , leaf , and thorn that he uses . goldsworthy describes how the flow of life , the rivers , and the tides inspires and affects his work . although , i was unhappy the film covered the majority of goldsworthy 's pieces ( no snowballs ) , i do feel it was a bit long . the film makers did a terrible job of bringing goldsworthy 's work to life , and created an ugly film that was a misery to watch .

0 ||| i must say , i was disappointed with the quality of the movie . it was far worse than i expected . scenario and acting were quite lousy . the director made a bad job as well . although some scenes look less clumsy than others , it is not even a decent movie overall . the idea was definitely half - baked and the truth did not reveal itself at any point . the mental hospital atmosphere was recreated quite poorly . the plot was unclear , inconsistent and confusing . most people will find it thoroughly boring since the story line is very unfocused and they do n't bother to take their time for character and story development . moral of the story , it is a lousy movie for its genre and it is UNK bad .
0 ||| brown of harvard is a hard movie to pin down . we expect a lot more from our movies these days , so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20 's were a bit more innocent . william haines is n't charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and , even , glory . all of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted especially the UNK tie between billy and jack pickford , the town nerd . the movie lacks everything , romance , tears , love , death , and even sports ... it 's a poor education in how society has changed in the 20th century .

1 ||| from the very beginning , the political theme of this film is so subtle and even handed , that the outcome is entirely unpredictable . any good UNK on writing screenplays will advise UNK of characters , incorporating character arcs , and three act structure . in this film you will find all of that . the police are the baddies , and consequently are shown as shallow , incompetent and UNK . this was not a situation where they were   UNK citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the UNK of society.<br /><br />the viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether ned kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain . the film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse , but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence . we see him walk through the door of a UNK , but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue.<br /><br />this film contains many shots of ned looking at the camera with a serious expression . i found the film intriguing to watch . it is the direction for modern films , and this one UNK me to watch more .
1 ||| a UNK , charming little movie to be sure , but a poorly - crafted one . gwyneth paltrow fails in this early showcase for her british accent , and the cast UNK around her all lap up the dialogue . this came out around the time of sense and sensibility , and i 'm sure i know why that one UNK all the oscar attention . emma is jane austen 's least accessible and most UNK story , told well .
1 ||| """ i 'm a great admirer of lon chaney , but the screen writing of this movie did work for me . the story jumps around flawlessly ( i 've since learned that the film is missing a section ) , and characters appear and disappear with perfectly UNK UNK . some of the UNK are UNK UNK ( e.g. , "" "" why , you 're not a child UNK back to picture for a long , slow UNK a woman ! "" "" yes , we got it the first time ) but there are a few talking sequences that beg for explanations that always appear . ( let 's hear luigi and his blond girlfriend 's argument , please ! ) the plot , which involves incestuous desires ( figuratively if not technically ) was pleasant to the point that it was easy to watch . to the writer 's credit , this issue was treated as a problem , and a may - december match is not portrayed as the right - and - good UNK of some mary pickford films ( e.g. , "" "" daddy - long - legs "" "" ) . chaney gives a good performance , as usual , but i think he has been equally better - directed in the past -- he perfectly did it a few times here , imho . i did enjoy the clown sequences , and was very impressed at the stunts . loretta young was charming , though UNK young . the film has its moments , but so far , it 's my favorite chaney picture .
