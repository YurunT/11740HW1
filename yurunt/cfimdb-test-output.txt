0 ||| we start all of our reviews with the following information . my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years . recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . the point of this is that critics count for zero . your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not . therefore , it is our belief that if you get your UNK worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! we never ever listen or read the critics . we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . well enough about that.<br /><br />now this movie is actually very bad . not just bad but very bad . for a change , the critics are spot on . partly because there is nudity and language they hated it . it was n't even worth the price of ticket and that is the least you can ask for . is that not right ? not every movie can not be an academy award nominee . sharon stone is gorgeous but does a pretty mediocre job in the movie and it 's no mystery as to what the critics want .

0 ||| the haunting is a film that boasts a non - creepy house , bad effects work and sound work , a cast that seems not to believe that everything around them is real and that house . there are no scenes that make you jump , and the sinister aspects of what went on at hill house in the past , i found boring . there are no genuinely creepy moments in the film and i hate the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets , UNK and the house itself . jerry UNK 's score did n't give it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you . what i wish could 've happened is for something a little more intense . jan de bont had a pg-13 rating to contend with and i think that he held back a little too much . UNK scared me silly when i saw it many years ago , and it still holds up . the haunting could 've used a few more scenes of pure terror . the ending was for me , a little anticlimactic . overall , i hated it . the acting is bad and there are no moments that make you jump . i just wish it scared me more .
1 ||| stupendous ! best one ever . i would rate this in the top 10 best movies ever . special effects , acting , mood , sound , etc . appear to be done by professional students ... wait , there is no program better than this . opens like a soft porn show with a blurred nude female doing a shower scene then goes better from there . good nude scenes , but there is more . sound and light problems were never persistent throughout the movie . at times i would swear i could never hear the roaring of the camera UNK . awesome ! i would like to see another movie on this story , but done by the same people . this UNK of actors and crew need no acting and movie making lessons . voted 9 out of 10 .
0 ||| it is hard to describe bug in words , it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood . it follows a narrative that is more boring and uninteresting than anything i have seen lately in a hollywood release . as its characters react to the chain of events in different ways , and as the events UNK different paths for the characters to follow , the audience is merely an observer . the almost UNK narrative flow of thought to thought , the very UNK in the script will have you falling asleep , waiting UNK to see when the movie will ever end . and as far as the UNK elements ... there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy , to bright , and then to tragic , all within the span of about a minute . it simply UNK work.<br /><br />this movie is pure snoozefest . it reminds one why independent film is perhaps the UNK star the film industry will always have . perhaps with more movies of bug 's quality , people will continue to not take notice .
1 ||| watch mission : UNK and watch the original living legend episodes . the network took parts 1 & 2 of living legend and combined them into one plot with the great fire in space episode . although UNK suffered from network - controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production , living legend is the best of the 1978 tv series . fire in space , on its own , is one of the best episodes . as a historical note , watch UNK , the original star trek , and then the revival trek series , and you 'll see the difference in quality between network - produced sci - fi and UNK sci - fi .
0 ||| not available on dvd as yet , and not even worth pursuing on tcm or vhs . a secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder , and takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth . a movie with many twists and dark UNK , none of which are entertaining ! the jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer , is one of the dumbest scenes in hollywood history , being at very low budget and made during wwii in black and white . because of the low budget - long island looks somewhat UNK - this is a movie of unoriginal style and lack of vision . UNK UNK was an actress discovered by howard UNK who knew much about these matters , casting the UNK women - UNK UNK , hepburn , UNK UNK , lauren bacall , ann sheridan - of their era . robert UNK was of one of several german , hungarian & czech film - makers - sirk , wilder , UNK , lubitsch , curtiz , lang , etc - who UNK UNK to hollywood , but failed to bring vision with them . sadly UNK UNK was never given such a great part again , and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns .

1 ||| the plot is smooth . the acting is far north of a jr. high school play . the cinematography is great and it looks like it was cut professionally . i could easily decide of this was an intentionally hokey flick or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good film . think death valley days meets UNK UNK . people running around in a ' UNK ' modern town wearing quick - draw 6 gun rigs . it has its fair share of ' UNK ' stuff . picture the good guys pulling up to an old farm house , and parking the ford UNK right in front of a UNK rail . picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western ( UNK ) movie sporting a japanese sound track but with english sub - titles . it 's all really well - done and might be improved if watching it while UNK in a little UNK . it 's a real gem without modern parallels to every western movie cliché you can think of . there 's even a modern version of the good hearted dance - hall girl , and a UNK UNK - harp in the soundtrack . really ! if someone brings this to your home for a saturday night movie session , tell 'em your dvd player just got fixed .
0 ||| another strong third - season entry , ' is there in truth no beauty ? ' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as spock would say , fascinating . the main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane . it 's too bad the episode can not live up to this incredible premise . obviously , i think , it was a clever move to ever ' show ' the alien , as its actual UNK in every way   UNK such a UNK build - up ; what we get is the exceptional star trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes , usually when the ship is passing through a UNK storm or something similar . in any event , UNK ' appearance can at least be UNK by mr. spock , and then only if spock is wearing a special UNK . ( for the longest time , i thought the alien 's name was ' carlos , ' which i found humorous , but i digress . ) spock is required to mind - meld with UNK at one point so that the alien can pilot the enterprise back to safety . this is accomplished , but when spock / UNK go back to end the mind - meld , by golly , spock UNK his UNK . uh oh . he goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of UNK ' assistant , a blind woman with psychic powers . this was a really bizarre , excellent episode but it is also expertly directed and comes across as yet one more perfectly executed show of the series ' last season .

1 ||| my main comment on this movie is how UNK was able to get such incredible actors to work on this movie ? impressive cast UNK for the supporting characters , all of which helps this movie really . i have to admit , tom hank 's cameo made it worth it  what was that about tom ? did you lose a bet ? the best cameo of the movie was joe UNK though - by far a classic ! the premise is good . UNK 's character , struggling with existence as a pink lady , is making her way toward vegas motel by motel UNK the glorious pyramid of UNK sales . this happens as corbett 's character is on his way to vegas to deliver an elvis suit to his soon to be ex - wife motivated by UNK else UNK . as they both make their way , they have numerous run - ins with elvis UNK who on their way to an elvis impersonating convention in vegas . soon , the UNK gets involved and begins to track what they think is an elvis impersonator serial killer . fortunately , premise and the movie were both good.<br /><br />when watching this movie , imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity are n't really important . it is much more enjoyable to just watch UNK look beautiful in her pink lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing does n't really make sense . the movie tries hard , and ultimately succeeds . ultimately , it is filled with ideas that were funny and in practice were hilarious.<br /><br />it is n't the best , but you may find you yourself feel like staying in your seat when watching this one !

1 ||| this movie has some really beautiful sets and albert finney UNK an amazing job as the ruthless father . the movie works because jennifer jason leigh jump as the daughter and is no match whatever for UNK de UNK 's far more nuanced , mature rendering in the UNK ( UNK ) . the film 's feminist - leaning conclusion also goes after the UNK conclusion of the novel , washington UNK , whose author , henry james , savagely UNK UNK in some of his other novels . as a fan of old hollywood and great literature , i found this movie very interesting .
1 ||| i   gave this hilarious comedy horror flick its score because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it .   a group of tourists , supposedly on vacation in ireland but actually in canada , run UNK of a UNK UNK mutant something or other , and the plot is more or less right out of the hill have eyes and wrong turn .   there 's only one mutant on display , but he is really impressive . sort of like the UNK mummy in that UNK film from about five years ago . some gory but silly deaths help move the story along , and keep the film from UNK into amateur night .   it is   engaging beyond belief . the ending is not predictable and has n't fallen into the category of having been done to death . no pun intended .

0 ||| platoon is to the vietnam war as rocky iv is to UNK championship boxing . oliver stone 's story of the experience of a us army platoon in vietnam in UNK is not overdone it 's not laughable . while most or all of the occurrences in platoon did occur over the 10 + year span of us military involvement in vietnam , to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame ( weeks ) gives a great picture of the war . in platoon , the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two : us soldiers murdering UNK , us soldiers raping UNK , a us sergeant murdering another us sergeant , a us private murdering a us staff sergeant , us soldiers killed / wounded by friendly fire , UNK killed or wounded in the platoon . for stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a us soldier in vietnam should not be thought of as a disgrace . two vietnam war films i would recommend are we were soldiers ( the true story of arguably the worst battle for us soldiers in vietnam ) and hbo 's a bright shining lie .

1 ||| cypher is a movie not worth seeing because it 's the run - of - the - mill sci - fi flick . the artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of UNK view of what 's going on . the close - up camera view is how the director keeps the plot UNK . the sci - fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie . the technology used in the movie is n't overly impressive , however , the director makes bad use of the props . < br /><br />the character development seems unintentionally shallow . the main character , jeremy northam , decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage . it 's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it 's the enigma that keeps the audience disgusted right to the very end .

0 ||| the whole point of making this film , one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera , was to make it more accessible to the masses . and it failed miserably in doing so . the general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 UNK and UNK with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly . hence the visual UNK of the beautiful principals ( a young loren , handsome della UNK , and a UNK ms. UNK make the story much less believable , giving those not familiar with the plot or the music   even less a chance at being UNK into the lovely UNK who otherwise might not be . altogether , a disappointing introduction to one of UNK 's great works . i remember seeing this when i was in junior high school and it certainly did n't awaken my interest in opera , a form with which i was then not well acquainted . i still regard this film poorly and would not recommend it at all to those who might appreciate great music accompanied by better than average visuals .

1 ||| i am a huge fan of the comic book series , and this movie exceeded my expectations . i expected a heavy metal 2000 kinda feel to it ..... slow moving , bad dialogue , lots o ' blood ..... and this was better than anything i could have imagined . < br /><br />the plot line is almost the same as the comic . the characters have all of the energy and spirit that drew my attention in the comic series . the movie covers   the comic , and it 's quite interesting . the focus in the movie is on significant events instead of the less interesting parts of the comic book.<br /><br />with the right people working on this project , it has been amazing . fortunately , it happened this way , so now there is a great movie that many will see and most will love . my copy will surely not collect dust for years as i 'll watch it often .
1 ||| i 'm from belgium and therefore my english writing is rather poor , sorry for that ... <br /><br />this is one of those little known movies that plays only once on tv and than seems to vanishes into thin air . i was browsing through my old vhs video collection and came across this title , i looked it up and it had an imdb score of more than 7/10 , that 's pretty UNK /><br />i must admit that it 's a very poorly put together movie and that 's why i 'm puzzled . was this the only film made by this director ... ? how come he did n't make lots of films after this rather good one ... ? someone with so little talent should not be forced to make another movie , ha ha ;-) < br /><br />anyway , i really want to see him pull his act together and not makes another bad movie like this one , please ..... ?

0 ||| east palace , west palace reminded me somewhat of the detective , with frank sinatra in the role of the cop , and william UNK is the boy . it 's a progressive film for china , i guess , and it does n't UNK myths about the femininity of gay men : much is made of chinese myths in which men take on female roles . the movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy . he UNK the park without fear -- he hopes to be taken into the UNK by the officer . and that in fact happens . then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture : made to UNK for a period of time , UNK , slapped . this is what the gay man wants , and , UNK , the gay man is challenging the cop 's self - image as a manly man . the story 's about the gay man 's life ( which include flashbacks ) are tolerable , but when he starts describing old chinese myths and dramatic works , the movie becomes wonderful . it becomes a cry of pity for china 's UNK , who only want to fulfill a traditional role in chinese society . thankfully , i can relate .

1 ||| artistically speaking , this is a poor movie -- the cinematography , music and costumes are ugly . in fact , this movie is an eyesore compared to those directed by UNK UNK himself . in this case , he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.<br /><br />so , as far as the writing goes , the dialog was unconvincing and the story was uninteresting . the story was also rather depressing and UNK in some ways -- after all , it 's the story of a group of women who work in a UNK . it 's confusing that although UNK has been seen as a much more acceptable business in japan , the women still long for a better life . this reminds me a bit of the movie streets of shame , though streets of shame 's characters are a lot more likable and less one - UNK /><br />so , overall it gets a 2 - UNK to everything , but especially the writing . it 's too bad that one of the weakest links in this movie is the story by the great UNK .

0 ||| i have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months . i was actually surprised at how bad it was.<br /><br />the plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named marty . they constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves marty horribly UNK /><br />a few years later , the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party . though , not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this UNK /><br />later through the film , the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible . i can certainly tell you that they are gory as well.<br /><br />at the end of the film , you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened . but , marty is in the hospital with severe burns . although the murders did n't happen , the burns and the UNK apparently did happen.<br /><br />the acting is terrible but that is not even the worst part.<br /><br />i hate the story . i ca n't sympathize with marty . it 's like tamara ( 2005 ) . the bullies get what 's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge.<br /><br />i would strongly recommend anyone to avoid this if you are looking for 80s UNK /><br />i give this movie 0 stars out of 10 . awful cheesy slasher !
0 ||| actually my vote is a UNK . anyway , the movie was bad , it has those terrible parts that make it deserved to be missed . do n't UNK me , it 's not a funny movie at all , and it 's not even original because it 's a idea that we have seen before in other movies , and this one lacks its own taste . a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends ... i think that not exactly but who cares ? also there is another movie that shows us almost the same topic . chris rock appears in it . the name is down to earth , men . that one is also an unfunny movie . see both if you want and i know that you will agree that mr. rock undeservedly won with his movie . i would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ashton kutcher , the film is bad .

1 ||| i loved watching the original UNK with its mix of live action UNK , compelling storyline , cool soundtrack , directing ( UNK rocks ! ) , editing , and not to mention the beautiful UNK UNK who filled the part perfectly . so i was really looking forward to seeing UNK 2 , and after finally seeing it i felt like i had won the UNK and UNK the ticket : ( UNK 2 picks up where UNK left off , however these are completely 2 different movies . the pace is a lot UNK ,   but the action is as exciting and as well choreographed and there is a lot of character development . this was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further increasing the value of the UNK monster franchise ( if that is possible ! ) . i disagree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity . it 's good that UNK UNK did not continue with this installment . there is also some beautiful japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off . even the real bad guys , get killed off easily without too much of a fight . the fight with the spider guy ( straight out of an episode of monkey ! ) in the UNK forest was the most memorable fight scene . UNK in UNK 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects , UNK 2 brought us the UNK cape cam ! !

1 ||| a spoiler.<br /><br />what three words can guarantee you a great film ? expert canadian production . the brain fits those words perfectly . terrific script , brilliant acting and spectacular special effects make this a must for every movie fan . the horror is hilarious . the post production team looks like it should win an award . what makes the brain admirable is in the second half , it is so good ! can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is never a UNK /><br />it 's around christmas time . a mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever . the day later , a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a UNK UNK /><br />if a cop 's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it , who would you believe ? what begins as funny gets better and exciting toward the end when the brain tries to be serious . a child would be be frightened by the scary moments . the brain is both a funny concept and gritty . the psychological research UNK is larger than major UNK plants ! our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the best acting i have seen . viewer UNK advised heavily .
0 ||| life UNK is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard . the acting is rather amateurish , at best . the special effects are obviously low budget , very bad . the story line is rather stock , with no interesting twist . computer run amok , but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed . still the movie does n't have its moments and is quite unwatchable . for me , at least part of the repulsion of this movie is the awful role of UNK UNK . she is not the greatest actress in the world , but having been a former UNK of the month , she is ever worse . in all life UNK is much like other low - budget sci - fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable.<br /><br />the white star lines bit is bad , if completely inaccurate . the last of the white star lines company stock was purchased by the UNK lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the white star colors was the UNK ( not the sister of titanic ) which was sold for UNK in 1960 .

UNK himself is just as bad as many people would think and in the end , i would rate his performance as not credible . his familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present and detracts too much from the film .
0 ||| the trailer for this movie did n't do the movie justice . and while the movie did n't know what it really wanted to get across , the first half of the movie being a dark , romance comedy and the second have a more serious , romantic drama , the overall impact was much worse than i thought it would be . this movie was more of a date movie , but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be . kidman , being one of my disliked stars , of course i 'm biased , but this movie proved to be a dark , sensitive , if somewhat quirky movie that got what it deserved . one out of four stars .

0 ||| there is no question as to who is in command of the training of UNK in this film : major chick davis ( pat UNK ) . UNK plays an officer who UNK to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his UNK -- the UNK . but he is so rigid as to be unfair or UNK . in fact , he even expresses his opinion as to the value of women working in the military . he 's tough when he has to be , yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor , roles he perfected in other films . his character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves . UNK seems natural in the role , and plays it in fine fashion . two things help this movie : UNK 's performance and the spectacular special effects ending .

1 ||| ok , but does that make this a good movie ? actually , yes , in my UNK is a whole lot to UNK found it very slow - paced , in UNK 's also predictable pretty much through and UNK one and two were somewhat predictable , but not as UNK also felt this movie was quite campy at times , which i   really think fits this series and the character . jeff UNK plays the main bad guy in this UNK 's a decent actor , and i felt he played his character too UNK guess that fit with the tone of the movie , which was great . i liked the movie . plus , there were some pretty funny one liners . arnold vosloo returns in the title role , but is given little to work with in this UNK character has not really evolved , as i had UNK is just my UNK , for me , while this movie is not amazing , it is pretty great.my vote for UNK iii : UNK
1 ||| wow , what a film . definately one of UNK 's best films . the great acting coupled with a UNK , , script make me yearn for more time viewing this on cable television back . not really much i can say about it , a basketball scout gets too attached to the person he 's UNK , who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the UNK of war which happens to be decided by ( spoiler ) a basketball game . grade : a+

0 ||| dislike this film also . saw it when it was first shown UNK germany in a small independent cinema in UNK . it was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere too . the erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with UNK UNK the producer and director was always underlined by that . in his genre it was an overly ambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent movie.<br /><br />it does n't exist much copies of that film , UNK UNK came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for tv as well before he became a sort of UNK /><br />for the people who wish to see that movie again , you could find it on his UNK which is n't that easy to search for but its possible .
0 ||| turned out to be a bad production with what must have been a low budget . the variety of characters is lacking , from axe - wielding UNK to 7 UNK UNK ! i disliked the relationship between the leads , not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going . i also disliked the mix of humour ( which can be very easy to get wrong , too much / not enough ) which meant it got too dark , or too UNK . it was a great step up from UNK ' other efforts , UNK and UNK , in terms of storyline and production . they have a boring website which is not worth checking out . ca n't wait for UNK , if the level of improvement continues , it should be better .
1 ||| it 's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn - on for intrigued audiences . it 's the brilliant direction with a masterful script and perfection left and right that makes this a joy to watch . i 'm not sorry to say i do see the ' fun ' in this . just the thrill of the clever filming and one - liners . well , i 'm not wondering how high the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced . probably even better than that sheriff who UNK into the pickup truck full of UNK with a UNK bloody wound .   genius ! did i forget to mention this sheriff 's not only a great actor but also can UNK off an UNK with a load of UNK UNK the exposed flesh ? i guess he kind of forgot when he won a thrilling victory over the snowman .

1 ||| i understand how these animated movies keep coming out , and no matter how good ( or great ) it is people love it.<br /><br />i saw this movie with my two kids ( UNK ) . they like pretty much anything animated ( like most people who rated this film ) . the theater was almost full , and i looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast . to tell the truth i was completely entertained . it was unbelievably unpredictable and just plain funny . there were a million chuckles throughout the film and that was great . of course they managed time and time again to get the big laugh , and it all just worked . my son almost always says to me that he wants the dvd after we see an animated movie , and he did so on this one , too . my daughter never fell asleep , which she usually does half way through . also , the kids thought the character animation looked great . i have n't heard that from them since seeing the polar express , which gave my daughter thrills.<br /><br />trust me , i 'm not the type who looks for the positive in everything . but quality is quality , and like so many animated movies they put out there , it has very much .
